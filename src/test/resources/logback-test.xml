<!--
  Logback configuration for TEST environment

  Purpose: Keep tests completely SILENT for clean test output

  This file takes priority over logback-spring.xml during test execution.

  Benefits:
  - No console noise during tests
  - No file I/O (faster tests)
  - Clean Maven/JUnit output
  - Easy to debug: mvn test -Dlogging.level.root=DEBUG

<configuration>

    <!--
      Completely suppress all logging during tests.

      This ensures:
      - Fast test execution (no logging overhead)
      - Clean test reports (only test results visible)
      - No file creation (no cleanup needed)

      To enable logging for debugging a specific test:
      mvn test -Dtest=PaymentServiceIntegrationTest -Dlogging.level.root=DEBUG

      Or in your IDE, add VM argument:
      -Dlogging.level.root=DEBUG
    -->
    <root level="OFF">
        <!-- No appenders = no output -->
    </root>

</configuration>
